# Arduino Twinkle star Player with a Piezo

This Arduino project allows you to play the "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" melody using a simple piezo speaker. It uses an Arduino board to generate musical tones corresponding to the notes in the melody.

## Components Required

To build and run this project, you will need the following components:

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Piezo speaker
- Jumper wires

## How It Works

The Arduino sketch provided in this project plays the melody of "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" using a piezo speaker. The melody is defined in the `notes` and `beats` arrays, and the `playNote` and `playTone` functions generate the musical tones for each note. The melody is played in the `loop` function.

## Arduino Sketch

The main Arduino sketch for this project is in the file `twinkle_star_player.ino`. You can upload this sketch to your Arduino board to play the melody.

## Setup

1. Connect the piezo speaker to your Arduino board. Connect one wire to a digital pin (e.g., pin 10 in this example) and the other wire to GND.

2. Open the Arduino IDE on your computer.

## Usage

1. After uploading the sketch, the Arduino board will play the "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" melody on the piezo speaker.

2. You can modify the `notes`, `beats`, and `tempo` variables in the sketch to change the melody or tempo to suit your preferences.

3. Experiment with different melodies by modifying the `notes` and `beats` arrays.

4. Have fun listening to musical tunes generated by your Arduino!
